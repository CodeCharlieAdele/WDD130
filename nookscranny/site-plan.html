      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the site is to easily display Nook’s store hours, and the products they sell for the island residents. There will also be a place to read about the store’s history and get to know the twins who work there, hopefully, endearing future customers. It will create a web presence for their brick-and-mortar store, with the intention of increasing sales within the store.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Nook’s Cranny is patronized by the residents of Island, a rural vacation island. The residents are looking for an enjoyable shopping experience where they can buy all their goods, see what’s new in the shop, and feel the welcoming comfort of a family store.</p>  <!-- change this -->
